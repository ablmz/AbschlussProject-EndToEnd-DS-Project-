# Final-Project

This is a Web-DataScience Projekt. This project consists of three parts:

Web Scraping: The Clinic Datas of 22 Hospitals in Lower Saxony Germany from klinikbewertung.de and Google Maps are scraped. In this project libraries and frameworks like, Scrapy, Selenium and BeatufulSoup are used.

Machine Learning Models: With using ML methods the data were processed and two different NLP ML Model were created. First of them predicts a review text as good or bad experience, second one predicts the star reviews. We used also Sentiment Analysis(Opnion Mining) as a NLP Method to classify Polarity and Subjectivity of reviews. As a Textual Data Processing Library we used TextBlobDE(German Version of TextBlob).

Model Deployment and Analysis Results: We show all Analysis Results and Machine Learning Model Results in a webpage. We used Flask to deploy our ML Models and we prefered http://blitzteam.pythonanywhere.com/
